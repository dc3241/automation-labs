# Pages Directory

This directory contains additional pages for the Automation Labs website.

## Usage

- This directory is for pages that don't fit into the app router structure
- You can also use this for API routes if needed
- Each page should be a standalone component

## Note

Since this project uses the App Router (Next.js 13+), most pages should be placed in `src/app/` directory instead of here.
